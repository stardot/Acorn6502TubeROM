Introduction
============

This repository contains the original source code for the Acorn 6502
Tube ROM, version 1.20, which does not appear to have been publically
released (only the earlier 1.10 version appears to have been
released).

The structure of the repository is as follows:

    original_sources.zip
              - a copy of the original Tube ROM source files, with the
                original <cr> line endings.

    adfs/     - disk images in ADFS (adl and dat) formats;
                these are generated by the make_disk_images.sh script
                which uses COEUS's AcornFsUtils package.

    logs/     - MASM build logs

    src/      - the Tube ROM source files

    tools/    - binaries for MASM (both DFS and non-DFS versions)

Assembling the OS Source Code
=============================

An Acorn Turbo (256K) 6502 Co Processor is needed to assemble the Tube
ROM sources. As originals are exceedingly rare, an alternative is the
emulated version provided by PiTubeDirect Fer-De-Lance (and later) as
Co Pro 17. The reset banner should say: "Acorn TUBE 6502 256K".

The source code is in Acorn MASM format, and a copy of the "Turbo"
version of MASM (called TurMASM) is included in the disk images.

Using ADFS:
===========

The disk organization on ADFS involves a single disk image containing
the tools (TurMASM), build scripts, source code, and sufficient free
space for the build process.

In the adfs/ directory are the following versions:

   Acorn6502TubeROM.adl - this is a 640KB interleaved disk image,
   suitable for writing to a floppy disk.

   Acorn6502TubeROM.dat - this is a 640KB non-interleaved disk image,
   suitable for using with BeebSCSI (e.g. rename it to scsi0.dat).

Transfer one of these disk images onto your physical hardware.

To assemble the sources, you just need to boot the disk (it contains
an appropriate !BOOT file)

Three versions of the Tube ROM are generated in the root directory:

The Normal Tube ROM for the external 6502 Co Processor, called NTOS:
    (this has a MD5SUM of 035dc1fff4097207994a9924b65f795b)

The Master Tube ROM for the internal 6502 Co Processor, called MTOS:
    (this has a MD5SUM of 9a055b7f3fe36efd583f7da643d4c452)

The Turbo Tube ROM for the Acorn 256K Turbo 6502 Co Processor, called TTOS:
    (this has a MD5SUM of 21ac62d06ba035e362340d8c1f670ff2)

Notes:
======

The sources contain the following change history:

; First version for MNG 24/10/85 (1.10)

; Second release 65C102 Boot ROM    SKS 16/01/87 (1.20)
; Also second release 6502 Boot ROM SKS 16/01/87 (1.20)
; ECR supplied by DBell 12-Jan-87

; Differences from first release :

;       Converted from UADE format to MASM format
;       Fixed bug in *GO   : *GO char in range &3A-&3F was legal before
;       Fixed bug in *HELP : *HELP subject now keeps quiet (unless subject = .)
;       OSWORD &0E number of parameter bytes bugs fixed (eg. for TIME$)
;       OSWORD &14 number of parameter bytes bugs fixed (ref. BCockburn)
;       *HELP code shortened by common abbreviation checking
;       Easy to change version numbers - only change at start of TOS01 file
;       Lots of MACROs added to clarify code
;       Labels changed to local labels where applicable
;       Turbo (extended 2nd Proc) versions can be conditionally assembled

There appear to a bug in the conditionally assembled Turbo extensions,
which I have called the "Reg0 corruption on IRQ exit" bug.

The bug affects all R4 IRQ (data trasfer) with a type 0..5, and the
affect is that REG0 receives an unnecessary ASL at the end of the IRQ
handler (without a preceeding ROR at the start). The result is the
turbo enabble/disable bit becomes indeterminate.

A fix for this involves adding 3 to the target of two branch
instructions to avoid an unnecessary ASL REG0.

See lines marked with <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< below

This v1.20 ROM has probably never been used in real hardware. Or in
real hardware the indeterminate state is always turbo enabled, which
might have gone unnoticed, but would break compatibility with
non-turbo apps.

The version included in PiTubeDirect has two one-byte patches to fix
this bug.
